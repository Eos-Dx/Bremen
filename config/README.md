# Aramis Human-1 Product Metadata

This directory contains canonical JSON/CSV metadata for the Aramis Human-1
research draft product workflow.

These files are product metadata prepared for Aramis by Slava Shcherbakov
(Viacheslav SHCHERBAKOV). Treat them as controlled product inputs, not as
ad-hoc notebook outputs.

Aramis is clinical decision support research draft work. These metadata do not
make the model clinically validated, FDA-cleared, or suitable for autonomous
diagnosis.

## Files

### `aramis_product_versioning.json`

Purpose:

```text
Human-1 versioning
data_batch definitions
K-alpha / K-beta source-line rules
Nova patient ranges
AgBH reference thickness rules
calibrant_thickness_mm field contract
required H5 metadata fields
product filtering policy
```

Use this file when deciding whether a measurement batch is product-usable for a
K-alpha-only Aramis workflow.

### `preprocessing/aramis_one_to_one_preprocessing_v0_1.yaml`

Purpose:

```text
Aramis one-to-one preprocessing config
decision unit: patientId
row unit: measurementId
grouping unit: specimenId
paired-breast patient rules
BENIGN/CANCER/NORMAL context policy
thickness correction requirements
SNR / normalization / profile-gate parameters
quality_exclusions by linked AgBH session ID with date fallback
```

### `preprocessing/aramis_one_to_many_benign_cancer_preprocessing_v0_1.yaml`

Purpose:

```text
Aramis standard one-to-many BENIGN/CANCER preprocessing config
decision unit: specimenId
row unit: measurementId
grouping unit: specimenId
BENIGN vs CANCER specimen-level policy
raw detector source policy: gfrm | npy | tiff
XRD-preprocessing version/tag tracking
metadata retention policy
H5-level filter rules
canonical measurement-position rule: P1 / P2 / P3 only
thickness correction requirements
SNR / normalization / profile-gate parameters
quality_exclusions by linked AgBH session ID with date fallback
```

This is the standard one-to-many research-draft dataset. It keeps breast-side
specimens with `specimen_status` BENIGN, CANCER, ATYPICAL, or PRE_CANCEROUS,
then maps ATYPICAL/PRE_CANCEROUS to the product CANCER group at `specimenId`
level.

### `preprocessing/aramis_one_to_many_benign_cancer_biopsy_preprocessing_v0_1.yaml`

Purpose:

```text
Aramis biopsy-only one-to-many BENIGN/CANCER preprocessing config
decision unit: specimenId
row unit: measurementId
grouping unit: specimenId
biopsy-confirmed BENIGN vs CANCER specimen-level policy
same XRD preprocessing as standard one-to-many
```

This is the stricter one-to-many dataset requested for first model work. It
uses the same branch logic as the standard one-to-many YAML, but additionally
requires `biopsy == true`. The biopsy filter is applied at H5 metadata level
before GFRM loading and repeated at DataFrame level as a safety check.

The rule follows the Human clinical-trial FDA notebook convention where the
biopsy-only cohort is selected with `biopsy_flag == True`.

### `preprocessing/*_minimal_v0_1.yaml`

Purpose:

```text
compact preprocessing config
inherits full branch config through local extends
keeps only metadata.output_columns in final joblib
uses separate minimal output_joblib_path
```

Use minimal YAMLs when a collaborator needs only the final normalized profiles
and basic product metadata:

```text
patientId, specimenId, side, position, dates
product_status_group / product_diagnosis
sample and calibrant thickness
q_range and radial_profile_data
snr_db and source trace
```

Reusable preprocessing YAML template/contract is owned by XRD-preprocessing:

```text
XRD-preprocessing/src/xrd_preprocessing/configs/preprocessing_branch_config_template.yaml
```

These files are the concrete Aramis branch configs that follow that template.
Each preprocessing YAML owns its own runtime paths:

```text
io.input_h5_path
io.output_joblib_path
```

The product command should receive only the YAML path:

```text
python -m aramis preprocess --config config/preprocessing/<branch>.yaml
```

Current XRD-preprocessing dependency marker:

```text
version: local
release_tag: v0.1.5-beta
```

Raw-data policy:

```text
gfrm:
  preferred production path when original vendor bytes are available

npy:
  allowed for synthetic tests and declared H5 raw/processed 2D matrices

tiff:
  declared source option for future H5 blob support
```

Do not silently mix these source types in one product run. The selected source
must be declared in the branch YAML and logged with the dataset artifacts.

### `aramis_preprocessing_v0_1_config.json`

Purpose:

```text
Aramis AgBH monochromaticity product-selection audit artifact
rejected AgBH session IDs
rejected AgBH dates for older-container fallback
AgBH shoulder-metric threshold
detector-distance/q-range eligibility policy
reference AgBH rows
calibrant-thickness policy used by downstream preprocessing notebooks
selection_contract explaining how exclusions were produced and consumed
```

Canonical location:

```text
Aramis/config/aramis_preprocessing_v0_1_config.json
```

The runtime preprocessing configs are the Aramis branch YAML files. Their
`filters.quality_exclusions` blocks hold the controlled exclusion lists. This
JSON explains how those lists were produced.

This config was generated from:

```text
Clinical_trials/Product/Aramis/Aramis_Preprocessing_v0_1.py
```

Initial exported artifact:

```text
Clinical_trials/analysis/aramis_preprocessing_v0_1/aramis_preprocessing_v0_1_config.json
```

The JSON carries its own `purpose`, `provenance`, and `selection_contract`
blocks with notebook path, documentation links, generation summary, rejected
session IDs, rejected-date fallback, and downstream consumers.

Exclusion rationale:

```text
Aramis/docs/agbh_quality_exclusions.md
```

Used by:

```text
Aramis/examples/aramis_dataframe_one_to_one_v0_1.py
Aramis/examples/aramis_dataframe_one_to_many_v0_1.py
Aramis/packaging/eosproduct_bundle/scripts/run_aramis_notebooks.sh
```

Regeneration rule:

```text
regenerate with Aramis_Preprocessing_v0_1.py or equivalent scripted export
update the JSON provenance block
rerun Aramis tests and marimo checks
rebuild eosproduct_onboarding_bundle.tar.gz
```

Thickness policy:

```text
filters.thickness.sample.column
  H5/sample attribute used to require specimen thickness before frame loading

filters.thickness.calibrant.column
  H5/session attribute used to require calibrant thickness before frame loading

integration.thickness_correction.sample_thickness_column
integration.thickness_correction.calibrant_thickness_column
  must match the filter columns
  these names are passed directly to AzimuthalIntegration
```

Current AgBH calibrant safety range is `10..40 mm`. Missing sample thickness,
missing calibrant thickness, or calibrant thickness outside this range means the
measurement cannot enter thickness-corrected azimuthal integration.

Current conservative rule recorded in JSON:

```text
include data_batch: 3, 4, 5, 7
exclude data_batch: 1, 2, 6
review required: null / unknown
```

Important: AgBH shoulder-metric review can supersede this draft batch policy.
If batch 5 is confirmed bad for the product workflow, update this JSON first,
then update downstream notebooks, docs, and MLflow artifacts.

Calibrant thickness rule recorded in JSON:

```text
before 2026-04-22: 40 mm
from 2026-04-22: 10 mm
preferred field: calibrant_thickness_mm
legacy alias: agbh_thickness_mm only for old backfill compatibility
```

### `human1_diagnoses_metadata.json`

Purpose:

```text
canonical Human-1 clinical metadata
diagnosis labels
patient/specimen metadata
BI-RADS fields
MRI / biopsy fields
specimen status
source Excel normalization
external_id -> patient/side/position parsing
```

Source workbook:

```text
/Users/sad/Downloads/Human-1 Diagnoses for Matador v4(5).xlsx
```

Do not use the Excel file directly in product notebooks. Product code should
read this JSON. If the Excel source changes, regenerate this JSON and rerun the
H5 audit.

Key contract:

```text
External ID format:
Nova_<patient_number>_<LEFT|RIGHT>_P<point_number>

Comparison key:
patient_external_id | side | position
```

### `human1_diagnoses_metadata_h5_audit.json`

Purpose:

```text
audit of JSON clinical metadata against combined_archive.h5
matched measurement keys
Excel-only keys
H5-only keys
duplicate keys
metadata mismatch summary
```

Use this file before building a product dataset from H5. It shows where H5
metadata differs from the canonical clinical metadata JSON.

Current audit summary:

```text
excel rows: 2086
excel unique measurement keys: 2083
h5 unique measurement keys: 2001
matched keys: 1996
excel-only keys: 87
h5-only keys: 5
mismatch rows: 779
mismatched keys: 558
```

### `human1_diagnoses_metadata_h5_mismatches.csv`

Purpose:

```text
row-level mismatch table for H5 vs canonical JSON
external_id_key
field
Excel value
H5 value
source row
H5 session path
H5 set name
```

Use this file to decide which mismatches are harmless normalization differences
and which require H5 backfill or product-filter changes.

## Product Rules

Canonical metadata flow:

```text
Excel/source document
-> canonical JSON
-> H5 audit
-> product filter
-> h5_to_df
-> preprocessing
-> MLflow dataset artifact
```

Do not silently change:

```text
data_batch policy
K-alpha / K-beta policy
AgBH thickness rule
diagnosis label mapping
BI-RADS fields
patient/specimen identifiers
H5-vs-JSON mismatch handling
```

Any change must update:

```text
JSON metadata
docs
notebooks/helpers
selected/dropped measurement manifests
MLflow artifacts
```
